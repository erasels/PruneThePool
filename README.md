# Prune The Pool
This mod adds a button above every card in the card rewards. When clicked the associated card will get replaced by a new randomly rolled card and it will be removed from the card pools, so it won't spawn again that run.

To balance the increase in power through mitigating RNG, the player starts with 5 charges, gaining some when killing elites and bosses.

Essentially, this mod allows players to slowly trim the card pool over the course of the run, to easier enable some synergies.
